The **UX Content Glossary** is an open experiment for anyone working with content in a UX field. The goal is to create a useful reference product that benefits collaborators, educators, and students across UX professions and cultures. (Content should be understandable to those for whom English is a second or more language.) 

At the same time, the experiment is an opportunity for collaborators — expectedly content people who spend too much time with MS Word — to learn new tools and technology in a collaborative and supporting way. Technologies you can learn something about besides basic use of Github itself, include Jekyll, YAML, Liquid, HTML5, CSS, JSON-LD, and Markdown. 

## Glossary content 

Writers and editors are encouraged to get involved. The idea is that people of less known status might do the writing based on industry research, while those who enjoy a more celebrated and published reputation contribute as editors and advisors to the writing and other aspects of glossary quality. 

All contributors, regardless of role, will be named on the index (homepage) of the glossary. Writer's, specifically, will also have their names on the individual definitions they contribute to.

There is a workflow and collaborative process -- which includes constructive debating -- to ensure the glossary develops in a productive way. Everything is explained in the project documentation wiki. (Docs are still fleshing out, so you might find a gap. Don't hesitate to [start an Issue if you have a question](https://github.com/content-strategy-forum/csf-glossary/issues).)   

## Glossary design and development

We strive for a clean build with impeccable code as much as content. The more technical among you are encouraged to weigh-in on glossary architecture, structure, and presentation. We use a GitHub Page and Jekyll, which is already in place, and we'll continuously improve the file tree, markup, metadata, and so on. YAML, Liquid markup, and JSON-LD are new to us at CSF, so anyone with more knowledge there is especially welcome. 

## Everything else

This is a _rolling_ project, meaning there is no end point to adding, cutting, refining definitions or improving the underlying technology as described. Since it is on GitHub, we expect contributions to be done the GitHub way, and that collaborators follow the protocols in place for working effectively and respectfully. 

The repository's wiki serves as **[project documentation](https://github.com/content-strategy-forum/csf-glossary/wiki)**, which answers (nearly) every question you might have at this point — even the one on the tip of your tongue now. It covers:

1. General information about the project (audience, scope, etc.)
1. How to get started with contributions.
1. How to collaborate and communicate progress.
1. Guidelines for content development.
1. Using GitHub (particularly in relation to this project).
