# The Content Glossary

The glossary is an open, collaborative project coordinated by CSF. This is an ongoing initiative — a _rolling_ glossary. The goal is to create a core set of common, practical terms that benefit collaborators across borders/cultures and user experience professions (content strategy, information architecture, interaction design, and so forth). 

The words "core" and "common" should be a clue to the scale of the glossary. While we don't put any limit on the number of terms, neither is the goal to create a comprehensive dictionary of every concievable content-related word. Nor should the result be overly biased to a given discipline, like technical communication or content marketing. Beyond that we'll let the collaborative process of building the glossary work the remaining details out. 

As far as the collaborative drafting side of this glossary goes, anyone working or studying in the content-as-service professions are welcome to pitch in (i.e. novelists, poets, songwriters, and the groovy like are probably outside of our domain scope). We especially encourage all such writers who have avoided GitHub to date to let down your guard and give it a try. This project gives you a great excuse to do it in the company of your own people without the worry of knowing code beyond a little Markdown formatting syntax. And if you've not used Markdown before, then it's a double win; you'll add that to your skills box too.

**Note to previous contributors:** We apologize for the inconvenience of changing the platform. The previous process of using Google Drive was unproductive and cumbersome for our scale (dozens of individual documents). By using GitHub, we add a much needed layer of versioning control, as well as improved collaboration tools like a dedicated [Issues](https://github.com/content-strategy-forum/csf-glossary/issues) tracker (the link is always in the menu above), an [editors team list](https://github.com/orgs/content-strategy-forum/teams/glossers), and the ability to create Trello-like sub-projects should a clear need arise for a specific focus. If you made writing/editing conributions in the past, we know who you are and you'll still get credit in the production launch. Any further writing/editing contributions for credit, however, will require having a GitHub account.

The rest of this README provides overview of the collaborative hierarchy and forseen project evolution from development to production. 

You should also see the [wiki for this project](https://github.com/content-strategy-forum/csf-glossary/wiki), which provides a lot of guideance for using GitHub, collaboration protocols, and style guidelines for definitions. We're writing the wiki docs as we go, so expect content to chunk and move as we refine it for improved usability.

## Collaboration hierarchy

We may adjust this workflow as we see how it plays out. But this is the initial working process.

### CSF

Repository owners, user doc writers (in [wiki](https://github.com/content-strategy-forum/csf-glossary/wiki)), and helpful techies. We write the songs that make the young birds fly. Oh, we write the songs, we write the songs.

### Editors

The team (called ([Glossers](https://github.com/orgs/content-strategy-forum/teams/glossers)) of principle editors tied to this particular repository. Editors make near-final to final draft changes based on existing [Issues](https://github.com/content-strategy-forum/csf-glossary/issues) raised from everyone else. Glossers can edit files directly in the repository, or, preferably, they can clone the repository to their local machines and sync changes without having to make a pull request.

Yes, sometimes change decisions need to be hashed out first among the concerned parties in the issues tracker. Diplomacy is a virtue. If there is ever a conflict of interest that can't be worked out between concerned parties, put the issue to majority vote. Or CSF's editor-in-chief will make a final decision so the process moves forward.

### Contributing writers

Anyone else with a GitHub account that contributes as a definition copywriter, graphics designer, or what have you on a draft-by-draft basis. To make significant contributions this way (e.g. write a full draft), you must be able to clone the repository to your local machine and make a pull request when ready to merge your contributions. A repo owner will review the request and pull if appropriate. 

You must be at this level or up to have your name added to the main page credits on the production glossary.

### Commenters

You don't have to contribute to drafts to have something to say. If you have a GitHub account, you may create new issues with a topic for discussion. If you don't have/want a GitHub account (silly person), then you may do the same in the [Glossary area of CSF Discussion boards](https://discussion.csf.community/t/glossary). Either way, we welcome whatever gripe you may have. Just keep it professional.

## Glossary objective and scope

(to clarify)

## Phases of development

We will proceed through 3 phases of development on no particular timeline. The work is done when it gets done:

### Draft phase

This represents the initial terms and working definitions here in the repository. People who contribute at this phase will be credited on the production site when it launches. CSF will make occasional announcements through it's other channels about glossary progress.

**Working glossary terms:**

We operate by a vetted list of glossary terms in relation to objective and scope. As with writing/editing individual definitions, the terms are also subject to friendly debate for inclusion or not.

**Working Definitions:**

All definitions will follow a specific structure, and the **definition template** (link forthcoming) is provided for use. Not every definition must have all the structural components (e.g. some definitions may not need images), but whatever components are used should be organized according to the standard.

### Production phase

When we have at least 50 definitions articles written and vetted (summaries, full defs, meta descriptions, any associated image files and captions, etc) from our working list of terms, the production glossary will be launched and become part of the overall rolling workflow. Additional terms/definitions will be added as they are ready.

The production location is expected to be `glossary.csf.community`, but this could still change. The main page of the site will include a project introduction, credited contributors, and an index of terms that link their respective definition articles. All very lovely and usable. 

Likewise, your lovely copy on the individual definition articles will be something to dance about, with lovely typography, generous layout, appropriate visual aides, and additional link features that connect the production articles with their associated drafts here in the repo.

### Post-production phase

The glossary will be an ongoing — _rolling_ — initiate. This means terms and definitions may be revised, added, removed, merged, or what have you as time goes by. The more contributions, the merrier, as long as everyone is courteous and collaborates by the outlined process.

As draft definitions evolve with time, Vinish (and perhaps other technical editors later) will ensure the production glossary evolves in relation, but after quality control measures and consideration to suggested changes, which is what the draft files are for to discussion such changes in the side margins and come to final decisions.
