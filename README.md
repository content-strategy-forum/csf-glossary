# The Content Glossary

The glossary is an open, collaborative project coordinated by CSF. This is an ongoing initiative — a _rolling_ glossary. The goal is to create a core set of common, practical terms that benefit collaborators across borders/cultures and user experience professions (content strategy, information architecture, interaction design, and so forth). The words "core" and "common" should be a clue to the scale. While we don't put any limit on the number of terms, neither is the goal to create a comprehensive dictionary of every concievable content-related word. Nor should the result be overly biased to a given discipline, like technical communication or content marketing. Beyond that we'll let the collaborative process of building the glossary work the remaining details out. 

As far as the "build" aspect of this glossary goes, anyone working or studying in the content-as-service professions is ideal for pitching in. We especially encourage all such writers who have avoided GitHub to date to let down your guard and give it a try. This project gives you a great excuse to do it in the company of your own people — writers and editors — without the worry of knowing code beyond formatting basics in Markdown. And if you've not used Markdown before, then it's a double win; you'll add that to your skills box too.

**Note to previous contributors:** We apologize for the inconvenience of changing the platform. The previous process of using Google Drive was unproductive and cumbersome for our scale (dozens of individual documents). By using GitHub, we add a much needed layer of versioning control, as well as improved collaboration tools like a dedicated [Issues](https://github.com/content-strategy-forum/csf-glossary/issues) tracker (the link is always in the menu above), an [editors team list](https://github.com/orgs/content-strategy-forum/teams/glossers), and the ability to create Trello-like sub-projects should a clear need arise for a specific focus. If you made writing/editing conributions in the past, we know who you are and you'll still get credit in the production launch. Any further writing/editing contributions for credit, however, will require having a GitHub account.

The rest of this README provides instruction for getting started.

## Collaboration hierarchy

We may adjust this workflow as we see how it plays out. But this is the initial working process.

### CSF

Repository owners, user doc writers (in [wiki](https://github.com/content-strategy-forum/csf-glossary/wiki)), and helpful techies. We write the songs that make the young birds fly. Oh, we write the songs, we write the songs.

### Editors

The team (called ([Glossers](https://github.com/orgs/content-strategy-forum/teams/glossers)) of principle editors tied to this particular repository. Editors make near-final to final draft changes based on existing [Issues](https://github.com/content-strategy-forum/csf-glossary/issues) raised from everyone else. Glossers can edit files directly in the repository, or, preferably, they can clone the repository to their local machines and sync changes without having to make a pull request.

Yes, sometimes change decisions need to be hashed out first among the concerned parties in the issues tracker. Diplomacy is a virtue. If there is ever a conflict of interest that can't be worked out between concerned parties, put the issue to majority vote. Or CSF's editor-in-chief will make a final decision so the process moves forward.

### Contributing writers

Anyone else with a GitHub account that contributes as a definition copywriter, graphics designer, or what have you on a draft-by-draft basis. To make significant contributions this way (e.g. write a full draft), you must be able to clone the repository to your local machine and make a pull request when ready to merge your contributions. A repo owner will review the request and pull if appropriate. 

You must be at this level or up to have your name added to the main page credits on the production glossary.

### Commenters

You don't have to contribute to drafts to have something to say. If you have a GitHub account, you may create new issues with a topic for discussion. If you don't have/want a GitHub account (silly person), then you may do the same in the [Glossary area of CSF Discussion boards](https://discussion.csf.community/t/glossary). Either way, we welcome whatever gripe you may have. Just keep it professional.

## Glossary objective and scope

(to clarify)

## Phases of development

We will proceed through 3 phases of development on no particular timeline. The work is done when it gets done:

### Draft phase

This represents the initial terms and working definitions here in the repository. People who contribute at this phase will be credited on the production site when it launches. CSF will make occasional announcements through it's other channels about glossary progress.

**Working glossary terms:**

We operate by a vetted list of glossary terms in relation to objective and scope. As with writing/editing individual definitions, the terms are also subject to friendly debate for inclusion or not.

**Working Definitions:**

All definitions will follow a specific structure, and the **definition template** (link forthcoming) is provided for use. Not every definition must have all the structural components (e.g. some definitions may not need images), but whatever components are used should be organized according to the standard.

* Title
* 

### Production phase

When we have at least 50 definitions articles written and vetted (summaries, full defs, meta descriptions, any associated image files and captions, etc) from our working list of terms, the production glossary will be launched and become part of the overall rolling workflow. Additional terms/definitions will be added as they are ready.

The production location is expected to be `glossary.csf.community`, but this could still change. The main page of the site will include a project introduction, credited contributors, and an index of terms that link their respective definition articles. All very lovely and usable. 

Likewise, your lovely copy on the individual definition articles will be something to dance about, with lovely typography, generous layout, appropriate visual aides, and additional link features that connect the production articles with their associated drafts here in the repo.

### Post-production phase

The glossary will be an ongoing — _rolling_ — initiate. This means terms and definitions may be revised, added, removed, merged, or what have you as time goes by. The more contributions, the merrier, as long as everyone is courteous and collaborates by the outlined process.

As draft definitions evolve with time, Vinish (and perhaps other technical editors later) will ensure the production glossary evolves in relation, but after quality control measures and consideration to suggested changes, which is what the draft files are for to discussion such changes in the side margins and come to final decisions.

## Style guidelines for writing/editing definitions

Oh yes.

### Punctuation and spelling 

We use the Oxford University Press references for punctuation and spelling (these instructions aside). For the most part this means punctuation outside quotaton marks, and British-English spelling conventions for most words (i.e. "dialogue" instead of "dialog", "colour" instead of  "color", and so on) except it's "z" (e.g. _‑ize_) instead of "i" (e.g. _–ise_) for words originating from Greek ([see explanation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_spelling)). For words originating from Latin, the "s" is retained. Now, don't you want to be on the Glossers team?

### Style and tone

Write with a neutral but friendly voice without too much personality. Use plain language. Use short sentence as much as you can, but don't kill a long sentence if it works well.

### Construction

Write the body of your definitions from general to specific concepts with the following in mind:

* **Original composition.** Definitions should not be copy/pasted from another source, and they should be better efforts than just paraphrasing. Use multiple sources as the basis for your definition, extracting the common concepts from across them. Do not footnote references if the source is not a dated source! (See References below.)
* **Examples for comprehension.** Provide simple examples if it helps clarify understanding. Add your examples either as parenthetical notes after a given, tricky concept itself, or give fully-phrased examples at the end of the definition.
* **Cross-linking.** If you're definition uses a term elsewhere in the glossary repo, surround it with double straight brackets, [[like this]], so we know to add the link later. 

### Related terms

If there are multiple, strongly-related terms but with slight differences in meaning (e.g. see _user journey_ in glossary): 

1. determine which is the most universal and use that as the main term to define, then 
1. use a numbered list to sub-define the other more specific terms under universal definition. 

### No buzzwords or jargon

Avoid suggesting the addition of “buzzy” terms, like _engagement_, _storytelling_, and the tiresome like. Such terms are either not easily agreed upon or easily abused to the point of having no meaning at all. If you're not sure about a term, ask yourself if a definition for the term can be given that most everyone would agree with across various UX fields. If you're pigeon-holing your definition into the context of marketing, for example, it's not a good term. This glossary does not centre around marketing.

### Formatting

We will use Markdown for formatting article drafts because GitHub favors it and it transfers easily to the production CMS when the time comes. 

Contributing writers are not expected to know a lot of Markdown, but you should be able to:

* make words **bold** (`**bold**`) or _italic_ (`_italic_`) as needed, 
* add links (`[link text](url)`), of course, and 
* create a footnote for references, described in next section. 

Images will also be used in some cases, but editors will be responsible for checking and formatting those, not authors (see Figures section below).

For the most part, 'glossers' here in the repo, and technical editors at the production end, will look for and handle final formatting and presentation tweaks, but any basic things you do ahead of time are helpful.

### References 

Every definition should have at least one reference from some respectable source! We're not inventing anything here, we're building on the knowledge that came before while shaping to adapt to the future.

References should be added as footnotes, with footnote numbers added to the ends of sentences for which references are most applicable. 

Do not use a source as a reference if the source **has no date of publication**! Dates are important for showing the value of the source relative to time. For our purposes on this project, if the source is not dated, it's considered dubious. 

It's fine to use the _ideas_ discussed in your source information as part of your definition. But do not plagiarize, or paraphrase so similarly as to be obviously lazy. And do not cite the work as part of the definition copy (e.g. "John Von Hämmer at JVH Media Inc. said 'dada, dada, dada...'"). Definitions should be free of such verbiage so they read clear and easy. 

We won't be keeping footnotes _and_ a comprehensive bibliography, so structure your footnotes in a more reference-like fashion. For example: 

```
Richards, S., [_Write user stories to share responsibility for content_](https://2016.agilecontentconf.com/richards), Agile Content Conference, 2016. Accessed 24 February 2016.
```

That ends up looking like:

> Richards, S., [_Write user stories to share responsibility for content_](https://2016.agilecontentconf.com/richards), Agile Content Conference, 2016. Accessed 24 February 2016.

### Figures 

Figures are encouraged when they enhance understanding of the primary meaning of the term, but they are not required in every case, and some definitions may be better without them. 

When a figure is intended, add the image file URL to the "Figure content" tab in the [glossary terms inventory](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jHT7VYY7YZ7aPAsXVt-tIOr1kwr_qkCOu02J0m1bT4k/edit#gid=58981596), and include a draft caption, `alt=""` text, and so forth in the appropriate row. Editors will take care of the rest, linking and formatting images in the draft and production articles.

## Example of "finished" definition

Here's an example of a definition that's considered finished enough to port to production — [user story](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KWdNljLUp5FW2-MFdbocOHtk5NH67gqQDbQDi08rnrs). That does't mean hands-off finished, but it's in a reasonably good state for common use. The draft file includes:

* title (the term itself),
* summary,
* full definition that's constructed reasonably well (if not yet perfect),
* cross-reference links to other mentioned terms,
* correctly formatted footnote references, and 
* all the associated record data cells are filled in for it in each tab of the [glossary inventory](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jHT7VYY7YZ7aPAsXVt-tIOr1kwr_qkCOu02J0m1bT4k/edit#gid=0), where relevant.
