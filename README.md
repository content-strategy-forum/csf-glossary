# The Content Glossary

The glossary is an open and rolling collaborative project for UX content strategists and other concerned individuals. The goal is to create a core set of common, practical terms that benefit collaborators across borders and UX professions. For complete details getting started, the collaboration process, and using GitHub (if you're new), see the documentation wiki.
