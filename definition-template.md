<!-- PRIMARY PARAGRAPH(S) OF DEFINITION -->

First para for primary term's explanation. Add the footnote reference number 
on the most applicable sentence related to referenced source.<sup class="ref">1</sup> Yadda yadda.

Or simply use the reference number at the end of a full paragraph, if appropriate.<sup class="ref">2</sup>

Use multiple paragraphs, if needed. 

Somewhere in relation to the primary explanation might be a figure.

<!-- FIGURE â€“ You can move this line to position among paras, but never delete it! -->
{% if ref="{{ page.figure }} %}{% include figure.html %}{% endif %}

<!-- EXAMPLE(S) -->

Use a new paragraph for each real-world example.<sup class="ref">4</sup> 

Each example should reference a source, unless theoretical.<sup class="ref">5</sup>

<!-- SIMILAR TERMS EXPLAINED, IF ANY -->

Use a new paragraph for each mention of a similar term. Similar terms are what we include in the glossary index as _secondary_ entries that redirect to the primary entry. So don't include a "similar" term if it's not synonymous with the primary term, or at least close. Any differences for close terms should be explained. Similar terms mentioned must have at least one (different) source reference each.<sup class="ref">6</sup>
