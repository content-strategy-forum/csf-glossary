<!-- DEFINITION BEGINS -->

Interface text refers to all the bits and pieces of text used in a given product's user interface (UI). Such text includes navigation items, headers, labels, system feedback messages, pop-up help dialog, title attributes, and so on.

<!-- FIGURE – You can move this line to position among paras, but never delete it!
{% if ref="{{ page.figure }}" %}{% include figure.html figure_info="page.figure" site_info="site.github" %}{% endif %}  -->

Interface copy should be the epitome of plain language writing; specific, concise, jargon-free, and void of any abbreviations, colloquialisms, clear in meaning (i.e., specific, jargon-free, keywords are put first, doesn't use abbreviations…), free of brand personality, clearly called out (e.g., the purpose of a list is made clear with a lead statement), and is real (i.e., no lorem ipsum or other fake text used in a [[wireframe]] or [[prototype]]).

Interface text is known by many other terms, including: interface copy<sup class="ref">1</sup>, interface strings<sup class="ref">2</sup>, interface writing<sup class="ref">3</sup>, microcopy<sup class="ref">4</sup><sup class="ref">5</sup><sup class="ref">6</sup><sup class="ref">7</sup>, and transactional content<sup class="ref">8</sup>, to name the most common.
