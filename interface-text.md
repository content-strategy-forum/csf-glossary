## Summary

The auxiliary text elements used in interface design — headers, labels, feedback messages, menu items, et cetera — that help people navigate and use application interfaces, whether for websites, mobile applications, kiosks, wearable devices, appliance panels, analog/digital dashboards or what have you.

## Body:

Interface text refers to all the bits and pieces of text used in a given product's user interface (UI). Such text includes navigation items, headers, labels, system feedback messages, pop-up  help dialog, title attributes, and so on.

Interface copy should be clear in meaning (i.e., specific, jargon-free, keywords are put first, doesn't use abbreviations…), free of brand personality, clearly called out (e.g., the purpose of a list is made clear with a lead statement), and is real (i.e., no lorem ipsum or other fake text used in a [[wireframe]] or [[prototype]]).

Interface text is known by many other terms, including: interface copy[1], interface strings[2], interface writing[3], microcopy,[4,5,6,7]  and transactional content[8], to name the most common.
